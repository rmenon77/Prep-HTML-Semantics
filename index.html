		<p>This is a true story about a lovely gray and white female cat, Missy, who gave birth to two sickly kittens. Sadly, within a very short time, both newborns died. It was heartbreaking to hear Missy crying and calling for her babies as she searched the house for her kittens. </p>

		<p>Missy was an indoor/outdoor cat who liked to hunt in a nearby field. Like many female cats, she liked to bring us her catch, and it wasnâ€™t unusual for her offerings to include mice, birds or chipmunks, sometimes still alive and kicking! </p>
